# ulid-lite

## About

An implementation of the [ULID] ("Universally Unique Lexicographically Sortable Identifier")
standard.

A ULID is

- 128-bit compatible with UUID
- 1.21e+24 unique ULIDs per millisecond
- Lexicographically sortable!
- Canonically encoded as a 26 character string, as opposed to the 36 character UUID
- Uses Crockford's base32 for better efficiency and readability (5 bits per character)
- Case insensitive
- No special characters (URL safe)

## Usage

### From the command line

The bundled application generates a ULID and prints it to stdout:

```console
$ ulid
01F5QNHN4G55VHQHA8XG1N6H9H
```

### From Rust

Here is a minimal application that uses this crate:

```rust
use ulid::{init, ulid};

fn main() {
    init();

    println!("{}", ulid());
}
```

To correctly use this crate, you need to ensure that `ulid::init()` has been called. This seeds the (pseudo-)random number generator provided by your system's `libc::rand` library.

The primary API is the `ulid()` function, which returns a `String`.

```rust
ulid::ulid() -> String
```

For more control, the `ulid::Ulid` type is also available.

```rust
ulid::Ulid::new() -> ulid::Ulid
```

The `Ulid` struct is a wrapper around a `u128`, with a few extra methods.

```rust
let id = ulid::Ulid::new();

// Ulid structs can be converted to strings..
let _: String = id.to_string();

// They implmement Display, LowerHex and UpperHex
println!("{}", id);
println!("{:x}", id);
println!("{:X}", id);
```

More recent ULIDs are higher than older ones:

```rust
use std::thread::sleep;
use std::time::Duration;

let a = ulid();
sleep(Duration::from_millis(1));
let b = ulid();
assert!(a < b);
```

### From C

An (experimental) C API is available at `lib/ulid.h`.

Here is a minimal application that generates and prints a ULID:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "ulid.h"

int main(void) {
    char str[27];

    ulid_ctx ctx = ulid_init(0);
    ulid_write_new(&ctx, str, sizeof(str));

    printf("%s\n", str);

    return 0;
}
```

`libulid` also provides access to creating binary (128 bit)
ULIDs and converting those to strings (this example is
intentionally convoluted to showcase error handling):

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "ulid.h"

int main(void) {
    ulid_ctx ctx;
    ulid_t id;
    char buf[64], *cur = buf;
    int n, size = sizeof(buf);

    ctx = ulid_init(0);
    ulid_new(&ctx, &id);

    n = snprintf(cur, size, "Your ULID is ");
    if (n >= size)
        return 1;
    cur += n;
    size -= n;

    n = ulid_write(&id, cur, size);
    if (n < 0) /* failed, typically buffer is too small */
        return 1;
    cur += n;
    size -= n;

    n = snprintf(cur, size, ".");
    if (n >= size)
        return 1;

    printf("%s\n", buf);
    return 0;
}
```


## Installation

At this early stage, this implementation is only available to people
who can install it from source:

```console
$ cargo install --git https://github.com/timClicks/ulid-lite.git
```




## Roadmap

### PostgreSQL extension

I would like to use this crate to develop pg_ulid extension.


## Warning: Work in progress

A few important features are not yet implemented.

- parsing pre-existing ULIDs 
- monotonicity within the same millisecond
- overflow checks
- no_std: at the moment, this crate uses the `std::time` module to access the clock in a cross-portable manner. Over time, I would like make syscalls directly.


## Why add another crate?

I wanted to implement a crate with a minimalist feel. It is intended to be easy and fast to build.
ulid-lite has minimal dependencies: its only external dependency is `libc`. 
This keeps build times fast and binary size small.

`ulid` does not take a long time to compile:

```console
$ cargo clean
$ cargo build --release
   Compiling libc v0.2.94
   Compiling ulid v0.1.0 (/.../ulid)
    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 1.44s
```

## Acknowledgements

I've relied on two other implementations to develop `ulid-lite`:
